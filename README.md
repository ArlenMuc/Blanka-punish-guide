# Blanka-punish-guide

People seem to still not know how to deal with Blanka balls so to help people with Blanka ball punishes I've decided to put out this helpful guide. Since some people have already done most of the work I'm gonna steal most of their hard work cause I'm a lazy fuck. Thanks to /u/SHINX_FUCKER and the commenters on reddit for the work getting Ryu to Blanka. OP found here https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/7zb2mu/every_possible_punish_for_lpex_blanka_ball_as/

As this was released when Blanka was released in season 3 some information is outdated, as well Blanka's ex ball was went from -21 to -18 in the vskill 2 patch so some of these punishes are no longer viable against both. I have gone through and updated the punish guide and included the characters released since then.

Also to answer the question of why there's inconsistency in punishes when blanka starts the ball too close his hit box starts inside the opponent sending him not as far back on block allowing for more punishes, and if you block crouching your hurt box is wider so Blanka goes farther back making certain moves not reach. 

I'm only going to include consistent punishes, the op post on reddit does include some inconsistent punishes for when blocked point blank or blocking it meaty. If I do not denote Stand in the notes assume the move can be blocked crouching. And if there's any thing I missed feel free to dm me on twitter @muc_flow
